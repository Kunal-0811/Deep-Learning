This project implements a Next Word Prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks in deep learning. The model is trained to predict the next word in a sentence based on the context of previous words.

Features:-

Data Preprocessing: Tokenization and padding of text data to prepare it for training.

LSTM Model: An LSTM-based neural network designed to capture sequential dependencies in text.

Training: Model training with text data to learn word prediction patterns.

Prediction: Generate predictions for the next word given a sequence of words.

Usage:-

Data Preparation: Preprocess your text data to create sequences of words.

Model Training: Train the LSTM model on the prepared text data.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the next word in a given context.
